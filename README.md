🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Luxury Housing Sales Analysis – Bangalore 🏡✨

In this project, I worked on analyzing over 100,000 housing records to uncover insights into the luxury real estate market in Bangalore. 

The workflow covers:
 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing using Python
 🔹 Loading and structuring data in SQL
 🔹 Building interactive Power BI dashboards for visualization
 🔹 Deriving insights into pricing trends, demand patterns, and key factors influencing luxury housing sales

💡 This end-to-end pipeline replicates a real-world enterprise analytics workflow—from raw data to business intelligence.
